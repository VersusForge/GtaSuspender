# GTA5 Suspender  

- Download the executable from https://github.com/VersusForge/GtaSuspender/releases
- Start the suspender and it will run in the background. You can see it running as a task tray icon.  
- Any Time you press Press Ctrl + F8 one time, the game will be suspended for about 10 seconds and resume automatically.
- So  just wait about 10 sec, and throw the lag you will be alone on the multiplayer map.  



- Press Alt + F8 to toggle suspend or resume manually in Gta5. Typically not needed.
